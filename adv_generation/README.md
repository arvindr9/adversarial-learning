# Adversarial generation

Included in this folder are the files for generating adversarial examples.

## File descriptions

* **adRandom.py** Script for generating adversarial examples (estimators are parallelized)
* **adRandom_est_eps.py** Script for generating adversarial examples (estimator-epsilon pairs are parallelized)
* **combineGraphs.py** Script for combining graphs
* **serial** Contains non-parallel version of adRandom

## Data

* **plots_gen** Generated data from adRandom (10 iterations of basinhopping)
* **est_eps** Generated data from adRandom_est_eps
